Hi there! You are currently looking at a PHP & Software Developer with over 10 years of experience who can build you concise PHP & Mysql based websites and technical solutions.

Given my experience, I have a range of skills in PHP Development including MySQL/Postgres/MariaDB knowledge, HTML, CSS, and VueJS/ReactJS skills.

I am a very experienced front-end developer with my background knowledge stemming from general PHP development and problem-solving through to bespoke systems development, often utilising the Laravel PHP Framework.

Not only can I provide a great technical solution to problems but I can also work with you to help look at existing processes and drive solutions forward.
